The Voiceflow Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables AI-powered code editors like Cursor and Windsurf, plus general-purpose tools like Claude Desktop, to interact directly with your Voiceflow API and documentation.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI applications to securely access external data sources and tools. The Voiceflow MCP server provides AI agents with:

* **Direct API access** to Voiceflow functionality
* **Documentation search** capabilities
* **Real-time data** from your Voiceflow account
* **Code generation** assistance for Voiceflow integrations

## Voiceflow MCP Server Setup

Voiceflow hosts a remote MCP server at `https://docs.voiceflow.com/mcp`. Configure your AI development tools to connect to this server. If your APIs require authentication, you can pass in headers via query parameters or however headers are configured in your MCP client.

    **Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "voiceflow-developer": {
          "url": "https://docs.voiceflow.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windsurf">
    **Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "voiceflow-developer": {
          "url": "https://docs.voiceflow.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
    **Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:**

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "voiceflow-developer": {
          "url": "https://docs.voiceflow.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Testing Your MCP Setup

Once configured, you can test your MCP server connection:

1. **Open your AI editor** (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. **Start a new chat** with the AI assistant
3. **Ask about Voiceflow** - try questions like:
   * "How do I [common use case]?"
   * "Show me an example of [API functionality]"
   * "Create a [integration type] using Voiceflow"

The AI should now have access to your Voiceflow account data and documentation through the MCP server.
