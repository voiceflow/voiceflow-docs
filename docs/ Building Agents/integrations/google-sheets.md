  To use the Google Sheets integration, you'll need to **OAuth into Google Sheets** from the Voiceflow Creator. This ensures your agent can read and write spreadsheet data securely from your connected account.

## What you can do with Google Sheets

The Google Sheets integration supports the following actions:

| Action                 | Description                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add to sheet           | Append a new row of data to an existing sheet.              |
| Create new spreadsheet | Create a completely new spreadsheet in your Google account. |
| Get rows               | Retrieve one or more rows from a specific sheet.            |
| Get sheet              | Retrieve details and structure of a specific sheet.         |
| Update sheet           | Update data in existing cells or rows within a sheet.       |

## Use cases

Here are some common ways to use Google Sheets in your Voiceflow agent's workflow:

* Log user responses or form submissions into a spreadsheet.
* Pull dynamic data (like product lists or prices) into a conversation.
* Maintain an up-to-date database of customer information.
* Track support cases or internal operations directly in Sheets.

Ensure you provide an `LLM description` for each tool to provide the agent with context for when to use them.

> E.g. for `Get rows`, you might provide an LLM description such as `Fetch rows from spreadsheet when user asks about all expenses from budget spreadsheet`.

  ### Be wary of each action's required arguments.

  Each action may require unique parameters such as `spreadsheetURL`, `sheetName`, or `rowNumber`. Decide whether these should be *defaulted, hardcoded, or collected by the agent*. Always provide LLM descriptions for each input variable so the agent knows exactly how to use them.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I write to multiple sheets in the same spreadsheet?

> Yes. As long as you provide the correct `Sheet Name` and `Spreadsheet ID`, the agent can target different sheets within the same document.

### Can I overwrite existing data?

> Yes. The **Update sheet** action allows you to replace existing cell values or rows with new data.

### Can I create a spreadsheet with multiple sheets?

> By default, the **Create new spreadsheet** action creates a single sheet. You can later add more sheets manually in Google Sheets or via the API.

### How can I avoid data duplication?

> When adding rows, ensure you include logic in your flow to check for existing entries before writing to the sheet.
