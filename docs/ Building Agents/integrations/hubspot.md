  To use the HubSpot integration, you'll need to **OAuth into HubSpot** from the Voiceflow Creator. This ensures your agent can securely create and manage CRM records from your connected account.

## What you can do with HubSpot

The HubSpot integration supports the following actions:

| Action         | Description                                         |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Create contact | Add a new contact to your HubSpot CRM.              |
| Create lead    | Create a new lead (prospect) in your HubSpot CRM.   |
| Create ticket  | Log a new support or service ticket within HubSpot. |

## Use cases

Here are some common ways to use HubSpot in your Voiceflow agent's workflow:

* Capture and store lead information from live conversations.
* Automatically create support tickets when a customer reports an issue.
* Add new contacts to your CRM when users provide their details.

Example:

> For `Create lead`, you might provide an LLM description such as `Add a new lead to HubSpot when the user expresses interest in our services but has not yet purchased.`

  ### Be wary of each action's required arguments.

  Each action may require unique parameters such as `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, or `ticketDescription`. Decide whether these should be *defaulted, hardcoded, or collected by the agent*. Always provide LLM descriptions for each input variable so the agent knows exactly how to use them.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I create both a lead and a contact at the same time?

> Not directly in a single action. You can chain actions in your flow so that creating a lead also triggers creating a contact.

### Can I assign a ticket to a specific team member?

> Yes, if you provide the correct `ownerId` or `assignee` parameter when creating the ticket.

### Can I prevent duplicate contacts?

> Yes. Include logic in your flow to check for an existing contact by email before creating a new one.

### Do I need to set up custom fields in HubSpot first?

> If you want to capture information beyond the standard fields, yes — create the custom properties in HubSpot before mapping them in Voiceflow.
