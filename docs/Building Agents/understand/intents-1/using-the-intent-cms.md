## Organizing Intents

* **Sorting**: Use the sorting options to organize intents by:

  * **Alphabetical Order**: A-Z or Z-A.
  * **Confidence Score**: High to low or low to high.
  * **Last Editor**: Group intents edited by specific team members.
  * **Updated Date**: Most recent to oldest.

* **Naming Conventions**:

  * Use consistent naming.
  * Make names descriptive and indicative of the user's goal.

* **Descriptions**:

  * Ensure descriptions are clear and start with "Trigger this intent when...".
  * Descriptions are used by [LLMs for intent classification](https://docs.voiceflow.com/docs/intent-classification-methods).

## Tips for Managing Intents

* **Keep Intents Focused**:

  * Each intent should represent a specific user goal or action.

* **Avoid Overlapping Intents**:

  * Ensure intents are distinct to prevent confusion during intent recognition.

* **Regularly Update Utterances**:

  * Incorporate real user inputs and feedback to improve accuracy.

* **Monitor Intent Performance**:

  * Use analytics to identify intents that may need refinement.

* **Use Representative Utterances**:

  * Include various phrasings, synonyms, and expressions users might use.
