## Adding the Button Step to Your Canvas

1. **Open the Step Toolbar**: On the left side of your Voiceflow workspace, you'll find the step toolbar containing various steps you can use in your project.

2. **Drag the Choice Step onto the Canvas**: Hover over Listen and locate the **Button step** and drag it onto your canvas where you want to introduce decision-making based on user input.

***

## Creating Buttons

### **1. Accessing the Button Editor**

Once the Button Step is on your canvas, click on it to open the **Button Editor**. This is where you'll create and configure your buttons.

### 2. Adding Buttons

* **Click the "+" Button**: Beside the **Buttons** label, click the "+" button to add a new button.
* **Enter Button Label**:
  * **Hardcoded Text**: Type the label text directly (e.g., "Yes", "No", "Get Started").
  * **Using Variables**: You can use variables in the button label by typing `{variableName}`. This allows the button text to be dynamic based on user data or prior inputs.

### 3. Multiple Buttons

* You can add multiple buttons by clicking the "+" button again.
* Each button you add will create a corresponding **port** (connection point) on the Button Step, allowing you to direct the conversation flow based on the user's selection.

***

## Connecting Button Paths

For each button you create, a port appears on the Button Step. This allows you to define what happens when the user selects that button.

### **How to Connect Paths**

1. **Locate the Ports**: In the Button Step, you'll see ports labeled with your button names.

2. **Connect to Other Steps**:
   * Click and drag from a port to another step on your canvas.
   * This sets the path the conversation will follow when the user selects that button.

### Example

* **Button "Learn More"**: Connect this port to a step that provides additional information.
* **Button "Sign Up"**: Connect this port to a step that initiates the sign-up process.

## Additional Options

The Button Step includes several toggles that enhance how it handles user interactions:

### 1. No Match

#### Purpose

* Handles situations where the user's input doesn't match any of the button labels or expected responses.

#### How to Enable

* Toggle **No Match** to **ON** in the Button Editor.

#### Configuration

* **No Match Reprompt**:
  * Provide a message to be sent when the user's input doesn't match any button labels (e.g., "Please select one of the options above.").
* **Follow Path After Reprompts**:
  * **Toggle ON**: After the set number of reprompts are exhausted, the conversation will follow the **No Match** path.
  * **Toggle OFF**: The agent will continue to reprompt indefinitely until the user provides a valid input.

#### No Match Path

* Enabling **No Match** creates an additional port labeled **No Match** on the Button Step.
* You can connect this port to a step that handles unmatched inputs, such as providing assistance or ending the conversation gracefully.

### 2. No Reply

#### Purpose

* Manages situations where the user doesn't respond within a specified time frame.

#### **How to Enable**

* Toggle **No Reply** to **ON** in the Button Editor.

#### Configuration

* **Inactivity Time**:
  * Set the duration (in seconds) the system should wait for a user response before considering it a no-reply.
* **No Reply Reprompt**:
  * Provide a message to be sent when the user doesn't respond in time (e.g., "Are you still there?").
* **Follow Path After Reprompts**:
  * **Toggle ON**: After the set number of reprompts are exhausted, the conversation will follow the **No Reply** path.
  * **Toggle OFF**: The agent will continue to reprompt indefinitely until the user responds.

#### No Reply Path

* Enabling **No Reply** creates an additional port labeled **No Reply** on the Button Step.
* You can connect this port to a step that handles no-response situations, such as ending the session or providing alternative contact options.

### 3. Listen for Other Triggers

#### Purpose

* Allows the agent to recognize and respond to other intents while the Button Step is active.

#### How to Enable

* Toggle **Listen for Other Triggers** to **ON** in the Button Editor.

#### Behavior

* **ON**:
  * If the user says something that matches another intent (e.g., "I need help"), the agent will trigger that intent, potentially jumping to a different part of the conversation.
* **OFF**:
  * The agent will focus solely on the Button Step, ignoring other intents until the user makes a selection or the step resolves through **No Match** or **No Reply**.

***

## **Summary of Button Step Configuration**

1. **Add Buttons**:
   * Use the "+" button to create one or more buttons.
   * Set labels using hardcoded text or variables.
   * Each button creates a port for connecting conversation paths.

2. **Configure Options**:
   * **No Match**:
     * Enable to handle unrecognized inputs.
     * Set reprompts and connect the **No Match** path.
   * **No Reply**:
     * Enable to manage user inactivity.
     * Set inactivity time, reprompts, and connect the **No Reply** path.
   * **Listen for Other Triggers**:
     * Decide whether the agent should recognize other intents during this step.

## Practical Example: Navigating a Menu

Let's illustrate how to use the Button Step in a conversation where the user is choosing from a main menu.

### Scenario

You want to present the user with options to **View Products**, **Check Order Status**, or **Contact Support**.

### Steps

1. **Add a Button Step to Your Canvas**.

2. **Create Buttons**:

   * **Button 1**:
     * **Label**: "View Products"
   * **Button 2**:
     * **Label**: "Check Order Status"
   * **Button 3**:
     * **Label**: "Contact Support"

3. **Connect Paths**:

   * **View Products Port**: Connect to a step that displays product categories.
   * **Check Order Status Port**: Connect to a step that asks for the order number.
   * **Contact Support Port**: Connect to a step that provides support contact options.

4. **Configure No Match**:

   * **Enable No Match**: Toggle **No Match** to **ON**.
   * **No Match Reprompt**: "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Please select one of the options above."
   * **Follow Path After Reprompts**: Toggle **ON**.
   * **Connect No Match Port**: Connect to a step that offers to transfer the user to a human agent.

5. **Configure No Reply**:

   * **Enable No Reply**: Toggle **No Reply** to **ON**.
   * **Inactivity Time**: Set to 30 seconds.
   * **No Reply Reprompt**: "Are you still there? Please select an option to continue."
   * **Follow Path After Reprompts**: Toggle **ON**.
   * **Connect No Reply Port**: Connect to a step that ends the conversation politely.

6. **Listen for Other Triggers**:

   * **Enable**: Toggle **Listen for Other Triggers** to **ON**.
   * **Behavior**: If the user says something like "I need help with my account," the agent can recognize this intent and respond accordingly.

### Conversation Flow Example

1. **Agent**: "Welcome! How can I assist you today?"\
   **[Displays Buttons: View Products | Check Order Status | Contact Support]**

2. **User**: "I want to see what's new."

3. **Agent**: **[Since "what's new" doesn't match a button label but could match an intent for viewing products, and Listen for Other Triggers is ON]**\
   "Great! Let me show you our latest products."\
   **[Proceeds to the View Products path]**

4. **User**: **[No response within 30 seconds]**

5. **Agent**: "Are you still there? Please select an option to continue."\
   **[Waits for user response]**

6. **User**: **[Still no response]**

7. **Agent**: **[After exhausting reprompts, follows No Reply path]**\
   "It seems we're having trouble connecting. Please reach out if you need assistance later. Goodbye!"

***

## Best Practices

* **Clear Button Labels**: Ensure button text is concise and clearly indicates the action.
* **Use Variables Wisely**: When using variables in button labels, make sure they are populated to avoid confusing the user.
* **Plan for Unrecognized Inputs**: Enable **No Match** to handle unexpected responses gracefully.
* **Manage Inactivity**: Use **No Reply** to keep the conversation active or end it politely if the user is unresponsive.
* **Consider User Intent**: Enabling **Listen for Other Triggers** allows the agent to be flexible and responsive to user needs beyond the presented options.
* **Test Thoroughly**: Simulate conversations to ensure all paths and scenarios work as intended.
