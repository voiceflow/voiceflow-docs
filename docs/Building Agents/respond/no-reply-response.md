When the user gives no response at all - remaining silent or away from keyboard for a certain amount of time - we can use the no reply feature. Under any "User Input" type step, there is an option to "Add No Reply Response" and designate a timeout period.

## Setting a global no reply

If you want your assistant to have a global no reply (i.e. at any point in the conversation), you can set this in the agent settings.

> 📘 We **don't recommend using this for chat experiences**, as users often leave and come back to an agent much later. This is more relevant for **voice** experiences.

By default, the delay for No Reply is **10 seconds**, but you can change this by clicking on the number like shown above in the global settings. This time can also be configured on a case-by-case basis for reach reply, and can have a path attached to the no reply case in certain conditions.

## Handling No Reply in Production

To handle interactions within the Dialog Manager API, we can reference the `no-reply` trace:

```
trace: [
  ...otherTraces,
  {
    type: "no-reply",
    payload: {
      timeout: 5
    }
  }
]
```

The responsibility of handling this is **on your client** that is calling the API. This would require a timer function of some kind that detects if the user has not responded within the `timeout` number of seconds. In which case, your next `request` should simply be `type: no-reply` to denote that the user has not replied, and then the API will handle the logic accordingly.

```
{
  action: {
    type: "no-reply"
  },
  // state, config, and other metadata here
}
```
